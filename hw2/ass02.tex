%% Q1
\section{DIE with a T}

I am on a diet. That means I can only eat upto 2,000 kcal (2,000,000 cal) a day.
I eat 4 meals a day(\textit{b}reakfast, \textit{l}unch, \textit{s}nack, and
\textit{d}inner) and life would be easy if
every food was exactly 500,000cal. But it isn't. So help me out.
From 4 different groups of foods(each for the 4 meals I eat) each consisting of $N$
foods, compute whether it is possible to select a food from each group
so that the total calorie intake is \textit{exactly} 2,000,000 cal.\\
\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.5pt}
\textit{INPUT}: The first line is integer $N$.
The \textit{i}-th line of next $N$ lines contains the four calorie value of each
meal, $b_{i}, l_{i}, s_{i}, d_{i}$.

\textit{OUTPUT}: Print \textbf{SUCCESS} if we can choose exactly 4 food so that
the total of calorie equals 2,000,000.\\($b_{i}+l_{i}+s_{i}+d_{i} = 2,000,000$)
Print \textbf{FAIL} elsewise.

\textit{CONDITION}: $ 4 \le N \le 10,000$, $ 0 \le b,l,s,d \le 1,000,000$

\textit{HINT}: The obvious approach would be to try every combination
of $4$ foods from each meal. However, this approach takes time proportional to $N^4$,
which is $10000000000000000$ in the worst case.
Therefore, instead of trying every combination, we need a better approach.
One possible approach would be computing \textit{partial} calorie $k$ in time
proportional to $N^2$, and checking whether $2,000,000-k$ exists in $constant$ time. This can be done by a $set$. Using a $set$ also has the added benefit of
\rule{0.5cm}{0.15mm} \rule{0.7cm}{0.15mm}, reducing computation time somewhat.\\

%% Q2
\section{Statistics Showdown}
Given $N$($N \% 2 == 1$) numbers, compute the following representative values.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Arithmetic Mean
  \item Geometric Mean
  \item Median
  \item Mode (The most common value)
  \item Range (max - min)
\end{enumerate}

\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.5pt}
\textit{INPUT}: The first line is integer $N$.
The \textit{i}-th line of next $N$ lines contains a single integer $n_{i}$.

\textit{OUTPUT}: Print 5 lines, each consisting of the Arithmetic Mean, Geometric
Mean, Median, Mode, and Range. For Arithmetic and Geometric mean, round to one
decimal place($1.75 = 1.8, 3.74 = 3.7$).

\textit{CONDITION}: $ 1 \le N \le 200$, $ 0 \le n_{i} \le 1000$

\textit{HINT}: Googling "root in python (other than square root)" would help
calculating the Geometric Mean.

%% Q3
\section{Prefix Calculator}
We usually write mathematical expressions this way:
$3+4*2$. This is called an infix notation, and although easy to understand, it has
some drawbacks.
%\begin{enumerate}
  %\item We have to know precedence rules of operators to correctly compute the
    %expression. Without knowing that '*' comes before '+', $3+4*2$ can be
    %miscalculated as $14$.
  %\item We have to use parentheses to express the intended order of operations.
    %$(3+4)*2$ if we want the result to be 14.
%\end{enumerate}
Therefore, there are other notations like prefix notations(operators precede
their operands), or postfix notations(operators follow their operands).
For example, using prefix notation, the expression above becomes $(+\ 3\ (*\ 4\
2))$.
To evaluate this expression, we start from the left, and when we see an
operator('+'), we expect two sub-expressions. We see a 3 and (* 4 2).
3 is 3. For (* 4 2), we repeat the step above, with an operator('*') and
two sub-expressions (4 and 2). Since there are no more sub-expressions to be
evaluated, we calculate $(*\ 4\ 2) = 8$, and $(+\ 3\ 8) = 11$.

TLDR; we are going to implement a mathematical expression
evaluator. For your convenience, I have already implemented infix to prefix function.

It's your job fill in $myeval(exp)$ to evaluate the prefix notation.

The \textit{i}-th line of next $N$ lines contains a single integer $n_{i}$.

\textit{OUTPUT}: Print 5 lines, each consisting of the Arithmetic Mean, Geometric
Mean, Median, Mode, and Range. For Arithmetic and Geometric mean, round to one
decimal place($1.75 = 1.8, 3.74 = 3.7$).

\textit{CONDITION}: $ 1 \le N \le 200$, $ 0 \le n_{i} \le 1000$

\textit{HINT}: The return value of infix\_prefix is formed as following.
\begin{alignat*}{3}
  exp &::= \ \  &&(operand, exp, exp)\ \  &&tuple\\
      &\ \ \ | &&n &&integer
\end{alignat*}
So, when the type of the expression is integer, (in python: $isinstance(exp, int)$), there
is nothing to calculate and myeval just returns $n$. This becomes the basecase
of recursion. For the tuple case, assuming that $myeval(exp)$ correctly
calculates the results of the two subexpression would help.\\
